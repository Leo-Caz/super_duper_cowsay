# Super Duper Cowsay

This is a end of semester project from one of my uni classes. The goal is to use the `cowsay` command in funny ways inside of bash scripts, then later to code our own cowsay scripts in C with twists like animating the cows, or turning it into a 'tamagochi' style game, where we need to keep the cow alive for the longest time possible.
